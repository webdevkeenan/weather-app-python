# weather-app.py

This project is a basic weather app that asks for a city (and optionally a state or zip code) and then contacts an online weather service. The service returns the weather data in JSON formatâ€”a structured text format that's easy for computers to read and write. The app checks if the location is valid, extracts details like the weather condition and temperature from the JSON data, and then displays the information.
